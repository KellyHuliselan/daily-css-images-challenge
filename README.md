## daily-css-images-challenge

In this repository you can find a simple html portfolio with images and links to my Codepen pens. Click on the image to see the pure CSS code.

I am participating in a 50 day pure CSS challenge. I will make a new CSS image every day according to a prompt of that given day. 

The goal is to improve my CSS skills, keep myself accountable and to have code to show to anyone who is concerned. Also, I like to illustrate and this challenge combines coding and illustrating.
